1. Will need an admin login and dashboard for admins to login as a "super users".
   1. This dashboard should be able to:
      1. see all alumni on the platform, categorized by cohort.
      2. list each alumnis job applications
      3. download each alumnis resumes.
      4. fetch each alumnis photo
      5. add photo urls to alumni profile
      6.
   2. The alumni dashboard should be able to:
      1. create and log in to account. (SSO?)
      2. create and edit profile (but editing admin setting will never be an option, we will create the admins from the terminal ourselves)
      3. create, edit and destroy job applications
      4. create, edit and destroy followups
      5. upload a resume pdf and docx format
      6. create reminders to follow up with jobs and have reminders sent through email on the morning of.
      7. have a calendar view where our reminders will be displayed
      8. Link with MeetUp API and display tech meetups on calendar
2. The entire site should be mobile responsive
